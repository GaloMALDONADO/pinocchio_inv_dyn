# pinocchio_inv_dyn
A simple simulation/control environment for multi-body systems in rigid contact with the environment based on the dynamics library Pinocchio.

You can start to get acquainted with the library by taking a look at the files in "python/pinocchio_inv_dyn/examples". This directory contains two examples, one with the quadruped robot HyQ (for which an urdf is already available in this repository), and one with the biped robot HRP-2 (for which we cannot provide an urdf, so you can use it only if you already have one).
Remember to start gepetto-viewer-server before running the examples.
